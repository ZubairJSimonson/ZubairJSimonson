## Hi there ğŸ‘‹

<!--
**ZubairJSimonson/ZubairJSimonson** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on homework!
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to use Github, among other computer-related things.
- ğŸ“« How to reach me: feel free to send me a message on Blackboard, so long as you are in the same class (CTI-110) as me.
- âš¡ Fun fact: My brother works for Google, so I always assume that I know nothing about computer since I compare my knowledge to his.
