## Hi there ğŸ‘‹

<!--
**ZubairJSimonson/ZubairJSimonson** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Zubair Simonson - zjsimonson@my.waketech.edu

My GitHub account, which thus far has only been used for a homework assignment, is a simple individual account.
The repository I have created is what you are reading right now. It reveals how to reach out to me, and that the contents are for a class that I am taking. 
Steps to clone this were: 1) Sign up for a Github account on the web browser
                          2) Add a respository
                          3) Download the GitHub app on my desktop
                          4) Sign in on the app with the same username as on the web browser
                          5) Press the "Clone a repository button" on the app
                          6) Watch the file appear on my laptop!
- âš¡ Fun fact: My brother works for Google, so I always assume that I know nothing about computer since I compare my knowledge to his.
